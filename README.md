Fashion MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras
This repository contains code for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

Usage
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow (pip install tensorflow)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
Running the Script:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., fashion_mnist_cnn.py).
Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using:
Bash
python fashion_mnist_cnn.py
Use code with caution.

Code Overview
The code is structured as follows:

Imports: Loads necessary libraries for machine learning and data visualization.
Data Loading: Loads the Fashion MNIST dataset and defines class names for each category.
Data Preprocessing (Commented Out): Demonstrates data normalization (commented out) and code for visualizing a sample of training images with their labels.
Model Building: Defines a sequential model architecture with a flattening layer, a dense layer with ReLU activation, and a final dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each class).
Model Compilation: Configures the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function (sparse categorical crossentropy), and metrics (accuracy).
Model Evaluation (Initial): Evaluates the untrained model's performance on the test set.
Model Training: Trains the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs (iterations).
Final Test Accuracy: Prints the achieved test accuracy after training.
Prediction and Visualization (Commented Out): Defines functions to visualize a specific test image along with its predicted class and confidence using a color scheme (blue for correct, red for incorrect). It also creates a bar chart showing the predicted probabilities for each class.
Notes:

The commented-out data preprocessing section demonstrates normalizing pixel values, which can improve model performance.
You can adjust the number of epochs (training iterations) in the model.fit call to fine-tune the model.
